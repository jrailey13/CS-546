            <h3>Use a small backpack or suitcase</h3>
            <p>It's always better to pack light rather than over pack. You never want to lug around a bunch of extra clothes/items that you don't even use. If you have a smaller suitcase, you will be much less likely to over pack.</p>

            <h3>Try new food</h3>

            <h3>Bring good shoes</h3>
            <p>While on vacation, you are often walking a lot more than usual. Make sure you have a pair of shoes with proper support. This will ensure your feet don't get sore and your joints remain protected.</p>

            <h3>Take a lot of photos</h3>
            <p>Vacations are often the times when you make memories that will last a lifetime. However, as time goes on, it's hard to remember everything you did on certain trips. Taking lots of pictures will ensure you don't forget all of those happy moments. A lot of times, seeing a photo from a happy time will bring the exact feelings you were experiencing at that time. </p>
