        <h2>Chicago, IL</h2>
        <p>The windy city! My family and I went on a trip to Chicago after a soccer tournament I had in Indianapolis. I'll be honest, I was not as excited for this trip because we usually take our vacations somewhere warm and near the beach. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Chicago and the many attractions it has to offer. Whether it's unique shops, breath-taking museums, or sports games...Chicago has many attractions that will make your trip memorable.</p>
